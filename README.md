# Glitter-Magshimim

Final project of first year in networking course in Magshimim.
The project includes Penetration tests for glitter website and app.
glitter.org.il, its an a fake social media that has a site and app. 
I made an docx file to document each entry point and collect the weak points Also made a swiss knife that include POC of all the vulnerability I found (written in python).

The site isn't working all the year, only when the students uses them for thier projects
